      <h2>About Our Cat Rescue</h2>
      <p>
        We rescue cats of all ages, breeds, and healths. Our goal is to place each cat with suitable foster pet-parents until 
        the perferct forever home is found. If cats come to us in pairs, we will only allow potential pet-parents to adopt them 
        as a pair. We do not separate cat families and friends from one another. Each foster pet-parent and forever pet-parent is 
        carefully vetted prior to being matched with any cats. We take each cat's safety and joy very seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have been rescuing and placing cats for over 25 years! Our volunteers and board members find this work to be 
        incredibly fulfilling. There is nothing we'd rather do than save and take care of cats. If you know someone who is 
        struggling to care for their favorite feline, please refer them to us. We will gladly help them care for their cat 
        or help them rehome their furry friend.

        <p>
          Mochi is 3 years old and sweet as can be. She loves cuddling on the sofa and purring when she's happy. Mochi 
          is great with other animals and by herself - she's not a picky kitty! If you take Mochi home with you, you'll 
          surely fall in love with her.

        <p>
          Charlie is a 1-year-old Scottish Fold. He can sit like a human and eat like one too. He loves mazes and mice. 
          Charlie has a very sweet temperament and enjoys watching people bake. He's not the smartest cat, but he makes 
          up for it with endless kindness.

        <p>
          Fluffanilla is the fluffiest cat in town. We don't know where the fluff ends and the cat begins. Luckily, all 
          that fluff makes for some great soft cuddles as long as you're not allergic to pet hair. She loves a good belly 
          rub.

        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bpwp/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/22105552/01.jpg">
        <p>
          Meowie is a very vocal and clingy cat. He doesn't like to be left alone and he has no idea what it means to be 
          quiet. He has a series of meows for every emotion. He also loves schedules, so if you don't feed him on time, 
          you'll hear about it!

        <p>
          KnightRider is a very brave kitty! She will protect you no matter how large the threat. She also loves driving 
          around in cars, and is a fan of sunglasses and leather jackets. KnightRider also has great hair and enjoys listening 
          to electronic music.
